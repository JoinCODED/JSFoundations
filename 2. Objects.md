# Objects

There's even more stuff? We already know variables, functions, functions without names, arrow functions, loops, array iteration methods, if-statements, and the pythagoras theorem and why plants are green. Do we need to learn about objects?

Well.... yes. You'll see why, trust me.

Let's say you have the following data on a single real-life person:

```javascript
const name = "Mshary";
const age = 25;
const interests = ["Art", "Humanities", "History", "Meditation", "Anime"];
```

These data points aren't connected in any way. They're separate variables. There's nothing here in the code that indicates that these are about the same person in real life. We can use an array to group them together, but the only way to access elements in an array is using index, which doesn't tell you what data point you're accessing, whether it's the name or age or whatever.

So objects come in to help with this. Here's the syntax for objects:

```javascript
const varName = {
  keyOne: ValueOne,
  keyTwo: ValueTwo,
  [...]
}
```

Objects consist of key/value pairs. These key/value pairs are knows as "`properties`". Each `key` corresponds to a `value`.

Here's an object that represents a real-life person:

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "Mshary",
  age: 25,
  interests: ["Art", "Humanities", "History", "Meditation", "Anime"],
};
```

You can expand on that and have an object inside an object:

```javascript
const person = {
  name: "Mshary",
  age: 25,
  interests: ["Art", "Humanities", "History", "Meditation", "Anime"],
  githubAccount: {
    username: "TheMshary",
    numberOfRepos: 1000,
  },
};
```

# Using Objects

## Dot Notation

So how do we access a value, such as the name, of an object? You can use the dot notation and type the corresponding key. Here's an example:

```javascript
console.log(person.name); // "Mshary"
// You can access the entire array and then access elements inside as normal
console.log(person.interests[2]); // "History"
// If it's nested, keep nesting the dots.
console.log(person.githubAccount.username); // "TheMshary"
```

You can use the dot notation to also modify any values:

```javascript
person.age = 26; // 2021
```

## Bracket Notation

Using brackets `[]` you can type the key as a string to get the value, like this:

```javascript
console.log(person["name"]); // Mshary
```

Dot notation is always preferred, but there are reasons to use bracket notation sometimes, like:

- If the key is a string with spaces
- If you don't know the key in advance. Example:

  ```javascript
  const someObj = {
    "shade of blue": "Aqua",
    "midnight sun": "rising",
  };

  const keyName = "midnight sun";

  console.log(someObj[keyName]);
  console.log(someObj["shade of blue"]);
  ```
